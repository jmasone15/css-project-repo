CSS Class Selectors: {
    You can add multiple classes to a single element.


    You can target elements by their tag and their class/id. For example: {
        <a href="#" class="active">
        a.active {
            color: green;
        }
    }


    The order in which you set classes to an element (class="class1 class2") is not important. What is important is the order the classes are written in the CSS file.
    For an element with two classes, the class that is defined at the lowest point in the css file will be given priority over the other class or classes.


    For example {
        Let's say I have a paragraph tag with the classes "big-red-text" and "small-red-text".

            <p class="big-red-text small-red-text">I am the text.</p>

        In the css file, the classes are defined as following {
            body {
                font-family: sans-serif;
            }

            .big-red-text {
                color: red;
                font-size: 30px;
            }

            .small-red-text {
                color: red;
                font-size: 10px;
            }
        }

        The applied style to the <p> tag will be a red text color and a font size of 10px because the class "small-red-text" is defined after the class "big-red-text".
    }
}
